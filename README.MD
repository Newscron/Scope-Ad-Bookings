# Maxi Banners
* Only require/support `img` and`click`.

# ContentAd Style Ads
* Layout is either `image` or `textanzeige`
* `image` represents a pure image-ad, no text.
* `textanzeige` depends on the template: It could be a two column layout where we really show a picture, or just the text and the image is a 1x1 tracking pixel.
* Further relevant values: `title`, `text`, `linktext`, `click` (target URL), `img` (an image that is really shown, or just a tracking pixel).
* `display_title` is a DFV legacy field that we ignore.
* `bformat` is a DFV legacy field that we ignore.
